# Python-ChatBot
A Simple ML and AI chatbot built with Python, 

The libraries used included: NLTK for language processing, Tensorflow && TFlearn for the ML, Random, JSON, NumPy and Pickly for Data saving. 

It was a fun project and made me understand, to some extent, neuron networks and machine learned training models. I ran the Chatbot tests 1000 times. 

Code sandbox used was Spyder.
